    <h1>User Manual</h1>
    Here is an overview on how to use the game and what functionality is available for each game mode.
    <br>
    <br>
    The game is played with a point-and-click feature. A filled out blue circle represents where the player is right now, hollow blue circles represent where the player can move next.
    <br>
    <br>
    The goal is to collect all controls in rising numerical order, controls are displayed with a purple circle and a corresponding number. Collecting controls is done by moving the player to the circle within a placed control.
    <br>
    <br>
    When all controls are collected the game is finished. Both your path and the most effective path is displayed.
    <h2>Pre-Made Courses</h2>
    Two pre-made courses are found here, mark what map you want to play by pressing it, and then press the "Play" button.
    <h2>Random Courses</h2>
    Here you have the possibility to generate a random course, choose what map, difficulty and number of controls you want to play. Press the "Play" button when you are satisfied with the settings.
    <h2>Build Your Own Course</h2>
    This is a prototype option for developers, to pre-make a course or more easily generate a JSON-file containing a graph.
    <br>
    <br>
    Here you can draw out nodes where a player is going to have the possibility to move and where controls can be placed.
    <br>
    <br>
    Nodes are placed by pressing the left mouse button. Note that the first node you place is always the starting point. Be careful to place nodes on the correct floor. 
    In the top left of the screen there is a counter which tells you what floor it is. This counter is changed with the "+" and "-" buttons. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Edges can be bidirectional or onedirectional. Bidirectional edges are created by a click-and-drag movement from one node to another, using the left mouse button. 
    Unidirectional edges are created by a click-and-drag movement from one node to another, using the left mouse button while also pressing the "shift" button.
    When creating an edges on stairs between floors, draw an edge with the right mouse button. After drawing the edge you must declare what stair it is by writing some identification for it in the pop-up.
    <br> 
    <br>
    Controls are placed by clicking on an already existing node again, with the left mouse button. The node will get a number on it representing what control is. The last control you create will be the goal.
