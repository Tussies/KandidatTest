    <h1>User Manual</h1>
    Here is an overview on how to use the game and what functionality is available for each game mode.
    <br>
    <br>
    The game is played with a point-and-click feature. A filled out blue circle represents where the player is right now, hollow blue circles represent where the player can move next.
    <br>
    <br>
    The goal is to collect all controls in rising numerical order, controls are displayed with a purple circle and a corresponding number. Collecting controls is done by moving the player to the circle within a placed control.
    <br>
    <br>
    When all controls are collected the game is finished. Both your path and the most effective path is displayed.
    <h2>Pre-Made Courses</h2>
    Two pre-made courses are found here, mark what map you want to play by pressing it, and the "Play" button consequently.
    <h2>Random Courses</h2>
    Here you have the possibility to generate a random course, choose what map you want to play, what difficulty and lastly the amount of controls. Press play when you are satisfied with the settings.
    <h2>Build Your Own Course</h2>
    This is a prototype option for developers only, to pre-make a course or more easily generate a JSON-file.
    <br>
    <br>
    Here you can draw out nodes where a player is going to have the possibility to move and where controls can be placed.
    <br>
    <br>
    Nodes are placed by simply clicking with the computer pointer on the map, to make sure a player can move between these a connection is needed. A connection is created by click-and-drag movement from one node to another.
    <br>
    <br>
    Choosing what nodes have controls placed on them is done by pressing a node giving them a number, the control number is indicated on the node.
